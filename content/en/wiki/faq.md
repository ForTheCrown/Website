  FAQ

## ðŸ”¹ Are there any rules?
Yes, there are some major rules. You can do `/rules` ingame.
## ðŸ”¹ How do I start?
Doing /wild will teleport you to a random location on the map. You may use this as many times as you want until you find your optimal location. But the command only works in Hazelguard.
## ðŸ”¹ What is Hazelguard?  
Hazelguard is the spawn region. It is controlled by the administrator(s), where most major events will occur.
It is also the home to the server's shops, where you can buy and sell resources with Rhines.  
Rhines can be used to trade with players, or buy things from other players shops, most of them are also located in Hazelguard.
## ðŸ”¹ How to go to Hazelguard?  
Region poles are used to teleport to (and from) locations on the server. Some compare it to instant bustravel, where the poles act like bus stops. You can do `/visit <name>` near these poles to teleport.  
To make your own pole, place two stonebricks and a chiseled stone brick on top. Now look at the chiseled stone brick and type `/movein`.
For more info about what commands to use, you can do `/polehelp`.
## ðŸ”¹ What is the Resource World?
The Resource World, often titled "RW", is a separate world where you can basically do whatever you want.  
It is preferred that you use this world to gather large quantities of resources.  
This is to keep the main world better looking. If you ever get lost within the RW, you can type `/warp portal`, to get back to the entrance.
## ðŸ”¹ How do I protect my builds?
You can use `/kit claim`, which will give you a golden shovel to claim areas with, and a stick to check if an area is claimed or not.  
To claim an area, simply right click a block in the opposite corners with a golden shovel. This prevents others from griefing your builds.  
To give someone permission to build in your claim, stand inside and type `/trust <player>`.
## ðŸ”¹ Can I get unbanned?
If you're banned from the server, you can make an appeal by simply messaging a staff member on discord or by creating a ticket in #open-a-ticket. We'll double check the reason why you got punished, and determine whether you deserve a second chance or not.
## ðŸ”¸ How do I get a Crown??
[Here's some info on the crown events :)](/wiki/crown_events)
## ðŸ”¹ How do I go to the end?
The end portal can be found in the throne room of Hazelguard's castle. The ender-dragon drops a dragon egg, and possibly an elytra too. You just have to respawn it (vanilla).
## ðŸ”¹ Am I allowed to stream or make videos?
Yes, you can publish your gameplay as long as you respect the /rules. To ease this process, we can unlock some extra perks for you such as a [streaming] tag in-game, a discord role and a channel to promote your videos. You can apply for these perks by creating a ticket in #open-a-ticket. We will verify your content is safe to share here.
