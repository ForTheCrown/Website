The server team is displayed in the throne room of Hazelguard's castle. 

<div class="screenshot"><img src="/images/hazelguard_throne.png" alt="Throne room"></div>

Staff members do not have a special title in-game. They are players like anyone else but dedicate some of their time to keeping the server awesome. If they become inactive or don't fit well within the existing server team, their rank will be removed. 

### Open positions

If you are interested in joining the staff team, we could use help in the following areas:
- **Coding:** helping with the server's custom plugin. For more information see [the docs](/docs/).
- **Artist:** creating server logo variants, PlanetMC server banner, server texture pack, in-game cosmetics, webstore art, collector cards, and so on.
- **Writer:** helping to write the player wiki on complex features such as dungeons, guilds, royal sword, and so on.
- **Server promotion:** bringing more attention to the server, for example through Youtube, Twitch or TikTok.

# Owner

This role is only assigned to Wout. In the past, co-ownership with JulieWoolie was attempted, but it mainly slowed down productivity.

The owner has to do some tasks such as: maintaining the webstore, server payments, maintaining server profile on vote websites, managing the staff team, the FTC website, Discord server and GitHub organisation, and so on. Any help in these areas is always welcome.

# Admin
This role is given to staff members that have passed the test of time. The only difference with the `Staff` role is that these players also have access to the server's console and the server's files. This allows them to restart the server and change configuration files.

# Staff

This role is given to players that have proven to be of great use to the server. These players always act in the server's interest instead of in their own personal interest. Players earn it through activity and proving that they can be useful in one of the following areas:
- Coding: These players help create and maintain the server's custom plugin code. Their importance to the server cannot be overstated, but prepare to be bullied by Julie.
- Improving: These players know how all features on the server work, know how to improve them and can provide their help in the process. For example: balancing features or economy management.
- Policing: These players know about all the rules and punishments, how to act maturely in conflicts and are able to diffuse sticky situations.
- Building: These players help build stuff. They get whipped into creative perfection by Wout.
- And more.

Players with this role have extra perms in-game, such as:
- Access to spectator and teleporting,
- Access to commands to punish players,
- Ignoring player claims,
- And more.

### History
The server used to have a Senate, where the most influencal players could voice their opinion on the state of the server, upcoming events and features. A private meeting was organized each month with all senators and staff members. Players were required to wear a Minecraft skin with fancy clothes lol

Past Senators: Wout, JulieWoolie, Robinoh, Zamator, Paranor, Monzin, Petty, Owen
