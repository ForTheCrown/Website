  More information about the Hazelguard guild.

Hazelguard is a unique public guild with no member limit, meaning anyone can join! There is also technically no limit on the guild chunks available to be claimed, however you may only claim as many chunks as your rank allows (see below). The guild’s leader is Wout, who founded the guild on the 1st December 2022.

## Hazelguard Ranks
Earn exp for the guild to increase your rank and start claiming guild chunks! There are currently only two ranks beyond the default one, but we’re working on unlocking more…
