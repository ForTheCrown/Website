## How do I use a Waypoint?
Waypoints can be utilized by using the `/visit <region name>` command, whilst standing within the 5x5 bounding box of a pole.

*The bounding box is outlined in the above picture to showcase the size and useable area.* 

You can also use a waypoint via the Waypoint list. This can be found on the sign located on the side of the Waypoint itself. Simply click on the sign and then on the waypoint you'd like to visit.

Right clicking on the residents sign will also display a list of the current residents of the region as seen below.

## How do I find or create a Waypoint?
A Waypoint can be found, or created. To locate a Waypoint, simply use the `/findpole` and make your way to the coordinates provided in the chat.

*Above image shows the `/findpole` command's output*


If you want to create your own Waypoint, you can use `/kit waypoint`. After that, you need to create a pole made out of two stone bricks in the bottom, and 1 chiseled stone brick on top.

If everything is built correctly, you should now be able to look straight at the Waypoint and Right-Click with the Waypoint Creation Tool. If everything has gone according to plan, the new Waypoint should look like this.

*The below image should appear in chat when the new Waypoint is created.*

## Editing functions of a Waypoint

When you Right-Click on the "edit waypoint" sign on a waypoint, it will open this menu:

- The head: Shows general information about the waypoint. Clicking this option opens up a separate menu (See: next section)
- Netherstar: Allows you to name your waypoint. To name it, purchase a "Region Ticket" from the <a href="https://forthecrown.buycraft.net"> webshop</a>. Rename the ticket and click the Netherstar with the item on your cursor.
- The barrier: Allows you to delete the waypoint
- The book: Opens the Waypoint List menu

- The Book: Allows you to change the region's description.  
This description will be shown when hovering over your waypoint in the Waypoint List menu.
- The boots: Allow you to change the waypoint's position.  
Moving a waypoint is done the same way as making one, by using the "Waypoint Creation Tool" and selecting a free waypoint pillar.
- The helmet: Lets you toggle the waypoint between private and public.  
Private waypoints cannot be visited without an invite and they do not show who lives near the waypoint. (Public waypoints still need to be named to let players visit without an invite)

## Guild Waypoints

Guild waypoints function exactly the same other than various options are locked behind the guilds personal permissions; for example the ability to move the Guild Waypoint location would be locked to the guild owner and anyone with the `Location` permission within the guild.

## How do I get back to my new Waypoint?
To get back to your new homepole, you can do `/home` when near any other Waypoint.

## How do I invite someone to my region?
If you want to invite someone to your region, you can do that by doing `/invite <Player>`.
