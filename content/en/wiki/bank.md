The FTC Bank is an area where players can use their Bank tickets to access two different bank vaults the normal Bank Vault and the Elite Bank Vault. Players can also use their Bank Crate Keys here to open up the Bank crate to earn a variety of different rewards. The FTC Bank also includes a Shulker Station and Community Chest area for people to share and store their items.

## How do I get a Bank Ticket?

Bank Tickets can be earned by voting for the server through the `/vote` links. You gain one Bank Ticket and one Bank Crate key per vote and you can only vote twice per day. After you have voted 10 times in a row (twice a day for five days), you will receive an Elite Bank Ticket. Tier 3 subscribers also receive access to `/kit elitebank` every two days and receive one Elite Bank Ticket.

## What rewards can I expect from the Bank?

The regular Bank Vault has a wide variety of high to low value items inside with the highest value items being locked away inside the safe. Players are given 40 seconds to grab as many items possible within the Bank Vault. A four lever sequence determines how to access the goods inside however this sequence will be different every time you enter the Bank Vault so be ready.

The Elite bank vault has much higher value items than the regular Bank Vault, hence the name *Elite* Bank.
