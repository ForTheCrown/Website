The Resource World is a seperate world that players can use to gather all of the materials necessary for their builds. The Resource World drops double resources to help make that resource collection process a little bit easier. The Resource World is reset when necessary so that players should always be able to collect the resources they need.

## How can I get to and from the Resource World?

The Resource World can be accessed via a portal in the server information building. The portal is located directly to the right of the building as you enter through the main entrance. There is also access to a desert resource world accessible via `/vr DesertRW` at any working Region Pole.

To leave the Resource World from the wild you can simply type `/warp portal` to teleport back to the main Resource World spawn and then you can exit through the portal to teleport back to Hazelguard. You can also exit by teleporting to one of your various set homes in the main world.
