Sword abilities are attachments that can be added to your 
sword to make it more powerful!
  
Each ability has a cooldown on its use. This cooldown is 
dependant on the sword's level. For example, the Dash 
ability has a cooldown of `[ 8s to 1.3s ]` Meaning that 
at sword level 1, the cooldown will be 8 seconds, and at 
sword level 30, the cooldown will be 1.3 seconds.
  
Abilities can also be levelled up to be more powerful. 
They can be upgraded by using them. These upgrades will 
last forever.
