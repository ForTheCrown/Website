Sword abilities are attachments that can be added to your sword to make it more
powerful!
  
Each ability has a cooldown on its use. This cooldown is dependant on the 
sword's level. For example, the Dash ability has a cooldown of `[ 8s to 1.3s ]` 
Meaning that at sword level 1, the cooldown will be 8 seconds, and at sword 
level 30, the cooldown will be 1.3 seconds.
  
Abilities can also be levelled up to be more powerful. They can be upgraded by 
using them. These upgrades will last forever.
  
To get an ability you must have the advancement required by it, as well as the
items required to craft it.
