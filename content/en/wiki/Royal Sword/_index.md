  Information about how Royal Swords work.

You'll start with a Wooden Sword Named "Traveller's Sword", and you can level it up to progress to eventually become a Royal Sword.
If you lose your sword somehow you can see "Gerhard" and gain a new sword for 500 Rhines!

To level up your sword each rank on the sword will will have different requirements and you'll see what you will unlock in the next rank.
Max Rank you can Reach is 30, all numbers are in Roman numerals. 

Royal Swords can be given special abilites as well to have some Combat enhancements which you can go to the castle tower in hazelguard
