## What are Dungeons?
The Dungeons are a set of player-vs-entity challenges for late game players (although anyone can give them a try). Each Dungeon level requires the player to gather Dungeon Items in order to summon a boss at the end. 

## What are Dungeon Items?
Dungeon Items are unique to the Dungeons, and are used to summon the boss at the end of the level. Normally, Dungeon Items can be obtained by killing mobs that spawn from the spawners in each Dungeon room. These mobs will be more powerful than vanilla mobs, so watch out! Dungeon Items are marked as such by purple text in their description. Dying in a Dungeon will cause you to lose some of your Dungeon Items!

## Good to know
- KeepInventory is set to true in the dungeons, so players do not have to worry about losing items.
- You can bring whatever and whoever you like to the dungeons.
- The Royal Sword eventually requires players to complete dungeon levels to upgrade further. It is optimal to defeat the dungeons when this sword challenge is active.
