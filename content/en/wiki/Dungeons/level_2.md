- A shield may be useful.
- A bow may be userful too.

## Skalatan Behaviour
Skalatan will switch between attacking with a sword and a bow every few seconds. It gives the wither effect when attacking you with melee, and uses a flame bow. <br>
<br>
Skalatan can only be damaged by the player with the item type it is holding. This means when Skalatan is holding a bow, it is invulnerable to melee attacks from the player, but can be damaged with arrows. When it is holding a sword, Skalatan can only be damaged by melee attacks from the player.
