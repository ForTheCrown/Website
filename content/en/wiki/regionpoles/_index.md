If you want to create your own Region Pole, you first need make sure you have a 5x5 area of any solid block. After that, you need to create a pole made out of two stone bricks in the bottom, and 1 chiseled stone brick on top. If everything is built correctly, you should now be able to look straight at the Region Pole and do the command `/movein`. If everything has gone according to plan, below information should appear in the chat.
