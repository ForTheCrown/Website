# Owner

This role is only assigned to Wout. In the past, co-ownership with JulieWoolie was attempted, but it mainly slowed down productivity.

The owner has to do some tasks such as: maintaining the webstore, server payments, maintaining server profile on vote websites, managing the staff team, the FTC website, Discord server and GitHub organisation, and so on. Any help in these areas is always welcome.

# Admin
This role is given to staff members that have passed the test of time. The only difference with the `Staff` role is that these players also have access to the server's console and the server's files. This allows them to restart the server and change configuration files.

# Staff

This role is given to players that have proven to be of great use to the server. These players always act in the server's interest instead of in their own personal interest. Players earn it through activity and proving that they can be useful in one of the following areas:
- Policing: These players know about all the rules and punishments, how to act maturely in conflicts and are able to diffuse sticky situations.
- Improving: These players know how all features on the server work, know how to improve them and can provide their help in the process. For example: balancing or economy management.
- Coding: These players help create and maintain the server's custom plugin code. Their importance to the server cannot be overstated, but prepare to be bullied by Julie.
- Building: These players help build stuff. They get whipped into creative perfection and are often bullied by Wout.
- And more.

Players with this role have extra perms in-game, such as:
- Access to spectator and teleporting,
- Access to commands to punish players,
- Ignoring player claims,
- And more.

### History
The server used to have a Senate, where the most influencal players could voice their opinion on the state of the server, upcoming events and features. A private meeting was organized each month with all senators and staff members. Players were required to wear a Minecraft skin with fancy clothes lol

Past Senators: Wout, JulieWoolie, Robinoh, Zamator, Paranor, Monzin, Petty, Owen
