## What are server crown events?

Server crown events are events that give players the chance to compete against each other for the crown. The crown events are held on a bimonthly basis and players are given 7 days at the start of the month to compete and achieve the best score or time possible.

## What is the crown?

The crown is a custom item that players can earn by winning the server crown event. The crown is an unbreakable item that even stays with you after death thanks to the custom Soulbound enchantment.

 The more crown events you win, the more enchantments and effects your crown will receive. These enchantments and effects can range from an increase in protection to increases in speed and health.

Server crown events can vary from things such as time trials and parkours to things like PvP events, PvE events, point based events and even build events for those that dont like to play high paced and adaptive styles of Minecraft. An example of one of the servers most ambitious crown events can be found <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/ftc-october-2023-halloween-event/">here</a>.

## What rewards do I get from a crown event?

A crown event's main reward is of course the crown itself! Alongside the crown, players will receive a King Plushie and a rhine reward for winning the crown itself. 2nd and 3rd place also receive a rhine reward slightly lower than that of the reigning monarch. The new monarch will also have their choosing of a custom rank to display on the server from King, Queen or Monarch until the next crown is won.
