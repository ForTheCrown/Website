### December
Each event of the year mixed into 1 massive event. Presents would spawn at 
random in hazelguard. When you clicked a present, it would either drop some 
goodie rewards or send you to a previous event.
  
Not all of the years events were possible however, only the following events 
were used:

- **Bat event (January)**  
You were teleported to a shut in cave and had to kill a swarm of bats, each bat
rewarded 1 point.

- **Endermen Event (January, May, February)**  
You were teleported to the end and had to kill endermen, if you killed more 
than your previous record, your score went up.

- **Pinata (March)**  
You were teleported to the pinata's arena and had to chase it down and beat it.
If you didn't hit it at all you gained 10 points for being a nice person.

- **Race (November)**  
You got a ticket to the Race arena and had to get the best time there. The race
event arena's score was factored in later.

- **PvE Arena (April)**  
You were teleported to the PvE arena and had to fight against illagers and 
pillagers. You'd lose the fight once you died or the point was captured by the
mobs.

- **Protect Harold (June)**  
You were teleported to a small arena and had to defend the villager Harold from
zombies.
