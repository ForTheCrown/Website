# Hello everyone!
In the future, whenever we have a significant update with a lot of information, we'll share it via a dedicated post on the FTC Blog instead of overwhelming the *#updates* channel on Discord.

## Minecraft update
- The server is now on version 1.20.2

## Form Changes

We recently put out a <a href="https://forms.gle/mgwH7q1YB99C4btX9"> form</a> where we requested you answer a few questions about the server. We have received a handful of responses and would like to thank those who have answered the form already. 

#### `/shop` Challenges
Thanks to a few responses on the form, it was brought to our attention that the `/shop` challenges have been too difficult, and time consuming to complete. In an effort to resolve this, we have removed a few hard-to-get heads, and we have also tweaked the drop rates of some other ones. The items and potions have also seen some re-arranging. 

#### Royal Sword Abilities
We also heard your feedback on the Royal Sword Abilities; mainly on the application process, and we have made the requirements for each ability more approachable.

- **Ender Pearl** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 32 ender pearls.
- **Twirl** has been renamed **Whirlwind** and now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 8 compasses.
- **Dash** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 3 Potions of Leaping II (1:30).
- **Far Reach** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and a Mending Fishing Rod.
- **TNT** has been renamed **Explosive Barrage** and now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 16 TNT.
- **Fire Ball** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 12 Fire charges.
- **Regeneration** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 3 Potions of Regeneration II (22s).
- **Strength** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and a Diamond Sword.
- **Weakness** now only requires 10,000 Rhines and 3 Potions of Weakness (4m).

## Waypoint Update
The Waypoint plugin has received a lot of attention in this latest update.
It has been ambiguous and hard to understand, but we've tried making it more user-friendly and easier to grasp.
  
For more information on the new Waypoint feature, check out the Waypoint entry on the FTC Wiki <a href="https://www.forthecrown.net/wiki/waypoints/"> here!</a>  
  
Huge credit to JulieWoolie for making this update.

## Miscellaneous
- A few "Launch Pads" have been added throughout Hazelguard.
- Removed a staircase in the spawn area to lead new players down the correct path.
- Re-added the purple glass path that leads to the End portal in Hazelguard
  
### Known Issues (Will be fixed in the next couple days)
- Hulk smashing never triggers, Instant TP is always used
- "Right-Click to edit waypoint" sign is not rendering correctly for non-waypoint-owners
